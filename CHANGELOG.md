# Change log

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.0.2] 2020-05-04
### Fixed
- Updated the excels dependency, getting rid of the bug that required the
  conditional formatting to be "repainted" from the template files after the
  results spreadsheets were generated.  Updated the README to remove those
  steps.

## [1.0.1] 2019-12-04
### Fixed
- Fixed a typo in one of the group definitions.  It was just a change from lower
  to upper case, and did not affect the results spreadsheets.
