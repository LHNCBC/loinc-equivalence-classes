The documentation with the rules for creating equivalence classes for selected
LOINC classes is in a Word document, which is edited on the LForms project
Sharepoint site (not public).  However, the Sharepoint site, while good for
collaborative editing, is not so good at capturing the reason why certain edits
were made, and for finding versions at significant points in the revision
history.  Git is better for that, and so occasionally we will be checking in a
version of the Sharepoint file here.  However, as a reminder that the copy here
should not be edited, it is being placed into a "do_not_edit" sub-directory.
